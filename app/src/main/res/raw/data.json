    "description": "<p><strong>Young Talent Programma</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wat doe je als Young Talent bij IVO Rechtspraak?</strong>\nHet antwoord op die vraag is een inkoppertje. Want ons Young Talent Programma draait maar om één ding: dat jij je talenten als ICT-professional maximaal ontwikkelt en inzet! We halen alles uit de kast, met een programma op maat van jou! In twee jaar tijd krijg je volop de kans om kennis en ervaring op te doen en je soft skills te vergroten. Je leert daarbij de nieuwste methodes en tools kennen, want bij IVO Rechtspraak lopen we daarin voorop. We werken bijvoorbeeld agile, in scrumteams en op basis van BusDevOps. Bovendien heb je óók nog eens maatschappelijke impact. Jij helpt de digitale rechtspraak toegankelijk te maken voor iedereen!</p>\n<p><strong>Verschillende richtingen</strong>\nWe zoeken Young Talents in verschillende richtingen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Informatie Analist</li>\n<li>Angular Developer</li>\n<li>Software Developer Java</li>\n<li>Software Developer .NET</li>\n<li>Software Tester</li>\n<li>DevOps Engineer</li>\n<li>IT Trainer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Je draagt heel concreet bij aan de digitalisering en het digitaal toegankelijk maken van de rechtspraak. Met toepassingen voor medewerkers van de rechtspraak, zoals rechters en de mensen van de Griffies. Voor ketenpartners, zoals het OM, advocaten, de politie of de kinderbescherming. Maar ook voor ‘de man of vrouw in de straat’ die met de rechtspraak te maken krijgt.</p>\n<p>Je werkt agile, in SCRUM-teams en op basis van BusDevOps. Lekker dynamisch en dicht bij de gebruiker. Ook pas je de nieuwste technologieën toe. Waar de markt stopt, ontwikkelen wij vaak zelf nog door. Je kunt je creativiteit dus goed kwijt!</p>\n<p>Benieuwd naar de ervaringen van Young Talent Niek Visser? Je leest het in zijn <a href=\"https://www.werkenbijderechtspraak.nl/nieuws/je-leert-de-kneepjes-van-het-vak/\">blog</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Hoe je programma eruitziet</strong>\nSamen kijken we welke richting jij het beste uitgaat en hoe we je het snelste ‘op vlieghoogte’ brengen. Dat is altijd een combinatie van werkervaring opdoen en leren, zo breng je nieuwe kennis direct in de praktijk. Je werkt in een team en hebt daarin je eigen inbreng. Daarnaast krijg je vakinhoudelijke trainingen, daar maken we duidelijke afspraken over. Binnen je team heb je een buddy die je begeleidt en zelfs een coach behoort tot de mogelijkheden.</p>\n<p>Aan je soft skills werk je samen met de andere deelnemers aan ons Young Talent Programma. In workshops leer je bijvoorbeeld met feedback omgaat en hoe je initiatief neemt. Het leuke van dit gezamenlijke onderdeel is dat je meteen de andere talenten uit jouw lichting leert kennen. Al zitten ze in een heel ander team. Handig om ervaringen uit te wisselen en gewoon gezellig!</p>\n<p>Ben jij een ambitieuze starter of beginnend professional? En wil je al je kwaliteiten benutten in een baan met inhoud én mooie carrièrevooruitzichten in de ICT? Grijp dan nu je kans en doe mee aan het Young Talent Programma van IVO Rechtspraak!</p>\n<p><strong>Wat we je bieden</strong>\nOm te beginnen een leuke, informele werksfeer.

Je zit in schaal 9.</li>\n<li>Je krijgt een Individueel Keuze Budget (IKB) van 16,37% over je salaris. Dit is inclusief je vakantiegeld en eindejaarsuitkering. Je kunt dit budget bijvoorbeeld laten uitkeren of in vrije dagen omzetten. Ook is het mogelijk vrije dagen te sparen.</li>\n<li>Je houdt werk en privé prima in balans, bijvoorbeeld met de mogelijkheid van 4×9 uur, thuis werken of ouderschapsverlof. Bovendien krijg je 144 vakantie- en 21,6 IKB-uren op basis van een 36-urige werkweek.</li>\n<li>Je hebt veel doorgroeimogelijkheden.

Je krijgt een OV-chipkaart waarmee je gratis naar je werk reist.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We verwachten in april 2021 te starten met het programma.</p>\n<p><strong>Wat we van je vragen</strong>\nDit zijn de dingen waar je volgens het ideaalplaatje aan voldoet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Je hebt een hbo- of wo-studie afgerond met een sterke ICT-component</li>\n<li>Je hebt niet meer dan 2 jaar werkervaring</li>\n<li>Je hebt ervaring met programmeren</li>\n<li>Je wilt veel leren en jezelf ontwikkelen</li>\n<li>Je bent initiatiefrijk</li>\n<li>Je houdt wel van een uitdaging</li>\n<li>Je Nederlands is uitstekend, zowel spreken als schrijven</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Doe je mee aan ons talentprogramma, dan vragen we ook altijd een Verklaring Omtrent Gedrag.</p>\n<p><strong>Meer weten?</strong>\nBenieuwd naar ervaringen van onze Young Talents of naar specifieke vacatures binnen het programma?</p>\n<p>Kijk dan op:\n<a href=\"www.werkenbijderechtspraak.nl/ivo-rechtspraak/young-talent-programma-ivo-rechtspraak/\">www.werkenbijderechtspraak.nl/ivo-rechtspraak/young-talent-programma-ivo-rechtspraak/</a></p>\n<p>Acquisitie naar aanleiding van deze vacature wordt niet op prijs gesteld.</p>\n<p><em>Trefwoorden: Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer, IT Trainer, Angular Developer, Platform Engineer, Software Tester, IT, ICT</em></p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Voor de versterking van het team IT4IT zoekt de gemeente Utrecht een IT-specialist op het gebied van Monitoring en End User Perspective. IT4IT is onderdeel van DomstadIT. DomstadIT is verantwoordelijk voor de ICT Infrastructuur van de gemeente Utrecht. De gemeente Utrecht gaat voor maximale automatisering van beheerstaken; selfservice is meer regel dan uitzondering. De Cloudtransitie is in gang gezet. Focus op regievoering verandert de monitoringbehoefte naar inzicht in beschikbaarheid en performance van de werkplek. Monitoring zorgt voor informatie om het gesprek met de partner te kunnen voeren. Daardoor verschuift de aandacht van infrastructuur monitoring naar end user performance.</p>\n<p>We gebruiken oplossingen van Netapp voor de storage. Voor database hosting gebruiken we Oracle, MS-SQL en MySQL. Telefonieservices leveren we op basis van een Avaya oplossing gecombineerd met een private en een openbare GSM-oplossing. Naast de specifieke product tooling zetten we de Microsoft System Center Suite in als enterprise oplossing.</p>\n<p><strong>Dit is je werk</strong></p>\n<p>Als IT Monitoring Specialist werk je binnen het team IT4IT. Samen met 4 enthousiaste collega’s werk je aan de monitoringsvragen van de hele gemeente Utrecht. Je meet bijvoorbeeld de prestatie van werkplekken en doet prestatiemetingen van softwarepakketten. Denk daarbij aan het monitoren van de verstrekking van uitkeringen en aanvragen van paspoorten. Met jouw inzet lever jij een belangrijke bijdrage. Je maakt deel uit van het Agile team dat de monitoring oplossingen realiseert met de meeste waarde voor de organisatie.</p>\n<p>Concreet betekent dit dat je:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>De Monitoring-vraag inventariseert en analyseert. De vraag kan komen van infra beheerders of technische en functionele applicatiebeheerders, echter ook van de niet-technische collega’s. Monitoring kan ingericht worden op alle lagen, van infrastructuur tot end user perspective.</li>\n<li>Technisch beschikbare management packs inricht. Waar deze niet beschikbaar is, bouw jij het custom management pack, stem je de thresholds af met de stakeholder en bied je het resultaat aan middels dashboarding en/of rapportages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dit bieden we je</strong></p>\n<p>We willen dat je met plezier naar je werk komt. Dat plezier bestaat uit prettige collega’s, een fijne werksfeer. Je doet interessant werk in één van de meest aantrekkelijke steden van Nederland. Samen met jou zorgen we dat alle inwoners van Utrecht prettig en gezond kunnen wonen, werken en meedoen. Dit doe je door datgene waar je goed in bent in te zetten.</p>\n<p>Onderstaand vind je ons aanbod:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Een 36-urige werkweek met een bruto maandsalaris tussen de € 2.756 en € 4.048 op basis van 36 uur (schaal 9). Het precieze bedrag stemmen we af op jouw kennis en ervaring. Inpassing in de tijdelijke aanloopschaal behoort tot de mogelijkheden.</li>\n<li>Tijdelijke arbeidsovereenkomst voor de duur van 1 jaar.</li>\n<li>Uitstekende verlofregelingen</li>\n<li>Een Individueel Keuzebudget (IKB) van 17,05% van je salaris. Jij kiest wat je met dit budget doet. Bijvoorbeeld extra verlof kopen of uitbetaling als vakantiegeld/eindejaarsuitkering. Of alles eens per jaar laten uitbetalen.</li>\n<li>Flexibiliteit in keuze van werkplek (thuiswerken) en werktijden. De mogelijkheid om 4x9 te werken.</li>\n<li>Ruimte voor persoonlijke ontwikkeling, diverse cursussen en trainingen.</li>\n<li>Vele andere voordelen: zoals (online) sporten met collega’s, deelnemen aan verschillende netwerken en activiteiten.</li>\n<li>Voor een overzicht van alle overige arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals reiskostenvergoeding kijk je <a href=\"https://www.werkenbijutrecht.nl/arbeidsvoorwaarden\">hier</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dit vragen we van je</strong></p>\n<p>Je hebt brede basisvaardigheden ontwikkeld en bent bereid om deze actueel te houden. Daarnaast ben je communicatief, tactisch en vasthoudend in je werkwijze. Van alle medewerkers vragen we inzet buiten kantoortijden, omdat de ICT dienstverlening 24/7 uur per week geleverd wordt. Groot onderhoud wordt bij voorkeur gepland in het weekend, zodat gebruikers hierdoor zo min mogelijk worden gehinderd.</p>\n<p>Onze belangrijkste verwachtingen waarop we je sollicitatie(gesprek) toetsen zijn:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aantoonbaar werk en denkniveau op hbo-niveau.</li>\n<li>Ervaring met monitoring met behulp van Microsoft System Center Operation Manager.</li>\n<li>Ervaring op het gebied van het maken van klikpaden en deze om te zetten in geautomatiseerde handelingen.</li>\n<li>Ervaring met End User Simulatie in combinatie met Microsoft System Center Operation Manager.</li>\n<li>Ervaring op het gebied van management pack ontwikkeling.</li>\n<li>Ervaring op het gebied van System Center Service Manager en ESM koppelingen is een pré.</li>\n<li>Goede mondelinge en schriftelijke uitdrukkingsvaardigheden in de Nederlandse taal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dit is handig om te weten</strong>\nEnthousiast geworden om als IT Monitoring Specialist aan de slag te gaan voor de gemeente Utrecht, solliciteer dan direct via deze <a href=\"https://vonq.io/3amVJkA\">link</a>.
